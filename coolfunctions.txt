put -> same thing as printf, has 2 more precisions : %x.y... where x is the number of times you print the string and y is the length of the string (nothing if full string)
str -> looks like put, takes precisions, arguments are the same as put ut returns the string mallocd
wii -> pretty much a strchr which returns the length of the string up until the character is found
len_m -> wii but returns the length of the entire line if the character was not found
expand_tab -> concatenates and mallocs a new array to an array of arrays
ft_print_cat -> args are : int, *char, control byte (0bxy) where x is whether or not you clear the screen and y stops the prog until you press enter
new_node ->
